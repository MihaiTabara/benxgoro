                <p>I am software engineer based in London, with a great passion for exploration of cultures and the outdoors. Another activity which I greatly enjoy is the art of Photography, and this is what this web page is about.</p>

            <p>My real name is Bogdan Guna and I wanted to create a persona to project myself in the Photography world. I'm shooting portraits, street and travel with mainly Nikons & iPhones that I have possessed throughout the years.</p>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>
